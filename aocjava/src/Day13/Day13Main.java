    carts on the top row move first (acting from left to right), then carts on the second row move (again from left to right),

    Each time a cart has the option to turn (by arriving at any intersection), it turns left the first time,
    goes straight the second time, turns right the third time, and then repeats those directions

        you'd like to know the location of the first crash.
