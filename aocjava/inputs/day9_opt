instead of 1 linkedlist or 1 array list, use a collection of N of them.
when doing an add at index n, skip forward to the right list (by querying the size), then add to that list.

average case add would be: N/2 + T/2N operations.
where T is total number of items

N = 3.
[0]
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1]
[2, 2, 1]
...

add first by spreading out and creating new lists
then down by appending/inserting to/in those lists.
